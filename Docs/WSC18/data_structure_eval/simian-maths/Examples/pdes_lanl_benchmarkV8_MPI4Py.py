"""
PDES LANL BENCHMARK is a benchmark to test parallel discrete event simulation performance
through a combination of communication loads, memory requirements, and computational loads

Overview
==========
Each entity A sends a "request computation" message to another entity B; upon message receipt,
B performs randomly weighted subset sum calculations on its local list data structure.
Each entity A also sends "timer" messages to itself with some delay before it sends another 
"request computation" message. The main parameters are as follows:

Communication Parameters
========================
n_ent: 		Number of entities
s_ent:		Average number of send events per entity
			Individual entities determine how many events they need to send 
			based on p_send and their index and then adjust their local intersend_delay
			using an exponential distribution. 
endTime:	Duration of simulation. Note that minDelay = 1.0 always, so
			setting endTime to n_ent*s_ent will result in one event per minDelay 
			epoch when running in parallel mode	
q_avg:		Average number of events in the event queue per entity
			For individual entities this is made proportional 
			the number of total events that the entity needs to send.
			Default value is 1. Higher values will stress-test the event queue
			mechanism of the DES engine
p_receive: Parameter for geometric distribution of destination entities indexed by entity index.
			Entity i receives a fraction of p_receive*(1-p_receive)**(i-1) of all request messages
			Lower-indexed entities receive larger shares
			p_receive = 0: uniform distribution; p_receive = 1: only entity 1 receives messages
p_send:		Parameter for geometric distribution of source entities indexed by entity index
			See p_receive for more details
invert:		Flag to indicate whether receive and sent distribution should be inverted
			If set to True: highest-index entity sends most messages

Memory Parameters
==========================
m_ent: 		Average memory footprint per entity, 
			modeled as the average linear list size (8 byte units).
			Each entity has a local list as a data structure that  uses up memory
p_list:		Parameter for geometric distribution of linear list sizes
			Set to 0 for uniform distribution
			Set to 1.0 to make entity 0 the only entity with a list

Computation Parameters
==========================
ops_ent: 	Average operations per handler per entity.
			Computational cycle use is implemented as a weighted subset sum calculation
			of the first k elements of the list with randomly drawn weights (to eliminate 
			the possibility that the calculation gets optimized away).
			Each entity linearly scales down the number of operations based on its local
			list size as determined by p_list.
ops_sigma: 	Variance of numer of operations per handler per entity, as a fraction of ops_ent

cache_friendliness:
			Determines how many different list elements are accessed during operations
			traded off with more operations per list element
			Set to p to access the first p fraction of list elements
			Set to 0.0 to access only first list element
			Set to 1.0 to access all list elements
			Set to 0.5 if no other value is known

PDES Parameters
========================
time_bins:	Purely for reporting purposes, this parameter gives the number of equal-size 
			time bins in which send events are sent
init_seed:	Initial seed value for random number generation. Built-in Python random number 
			generator is used. Seed values are passed along to entities upon creation and
			also as parameters for graph/matrix generation

Output statistics are written into the output file of entity 0.
